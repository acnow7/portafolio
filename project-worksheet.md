## Project Description

In this project Golf Info App, I am building a interactive plataform React based where the user have access 
to incredible amount of data and stadisticts of his favorite professional golf player. He would be able to acceess
individual player biographical information for a given year and tour, for all players. This includes height, weight, place of birth, date of birth, residence, and college. Also Official World Golf Rankings and points for top the 200 players. Also historical tournaments statistics for a given player, among other data.


## API

[https://developer.sportradar.com/](https://developer.sportradar.com/)

This is the API that I would be using for my App. Making different request for different type of information.
Here is a sample of data fetched. [Data Fetch](http://api.sportradar.us/golf/trial/v3/en/players/wgr/2019/rankings.json?api_key=u7s35a5wy4w49huft39zypj9)
